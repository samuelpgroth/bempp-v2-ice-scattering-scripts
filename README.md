# bempp_ice_scattering
BEM++ python scripts for light scattering by ice crystal calculations
These files accompany the paper "The boundary element method for light scattering by ice crystals
and its implementation in BEM++" by S. P. Groth, A. J. Baran, T. Betcke, S. Havemann, W. Smigaj

Note that these scripts do not work with the most recent version of BEM++. See the other repository for updated scripts that work with BEM++ version 3.
